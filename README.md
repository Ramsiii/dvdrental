The task from WGU: "Summarize one real-world written business report that can be created from the DVD Dataset."

The hypothetical scenario:

"Which are the 100 most popular titles over time?"
The year is 2006. I aim to acquire a currently-operating DVD Rental business to launch an online movie platform with a subscription service. 
I will utilize its rental data to choose which 100 movies to start with. Clients will pay for tiers of “movies per week,” and the movies will be automatically downloaded to their home PCs by a specific date. 
Because of limited bandwidth, I aim to start by digitizing the first 100 most popular movies and add new releases over time. My project aims to answer the question “Which are the 100 most popular titles over time?”
