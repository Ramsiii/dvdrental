You are expected to create two tables that differ in granularity of the data they present.
2:43
The summary table is the one that should contain aggregated data to answer the business question.
2:49
And for this Performance Assessment you will be submitting a written document as well as a Panopto video.

Keep in mind that you really want to make sure you provide answers to A1 through A6 very explicitly.
3:15
Part A is asking you to summarize the business report that you will create from the DVDRental database provided in the virtual lab.
3:21
For part A, you will want to write a few sentences, or maybe even a small paragraph summarizing your business report.



Idea for analysis:

The year is 1995.
I plan to acquire a DVD Rental Store to Create a Streaming Service starting with 
a small catalog of digitized DVDs from the store.

Questions to ask:
THIS ONE: Which titles are the most popular over time?

NOT THESE:
*********************
Which titles are rented repeatedly by the same customer?
Which titles are returned late the most often?
Which titles have never been rented/have been rented the least often?
**********************


Questions to answer in Project Doc for section A of WGU project:

1. Identify which fields will be included in the detailed table and the summary table?
2. Describe the types of data fields used for the report. (For A2, you will need to 
describe the information that each field from part A1 will contain, as well as their data type.
This means you will need to identify if the field is going to be varchar, timestamp, integer and so on.)
3. Identify at least two specific tables from the given dataset that will provide the data necessary 
for the detailed table section and the summary table section of the report.
4. Identify at least one field in the detailed table section that will require a custom transformation with a 
user-defined function and explain why it should be transformed 
(e.g., you might translate a field with a value of N to No and Y to Yes).
"""
(This requires you to explain why the data you chose to transform should be transformed.
For instance, is there a business use for it?)
5. Explain the different business uses of the detailed table section and the summary table section of the report.
(As you answer this part, keep in mind the difference in granularity of your tables.)
6. Explain how frequently your report should be refreshed to remain relevant to stakeholders.
